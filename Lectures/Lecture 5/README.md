# Lecture 5: Python, Memory and Systems

Monday, October 19, 2026 · Advanced Python I · 9 a.m.–noon Pacific.

This lesson connects interview foundations—scope, mutation, functions, objects, and iteration—to memory use, CPU/GPU roles, and independently checked agent tools. Deeper GPU execution and KV-cache material is reserved for Thursday.

## Monday teaching package

- [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xA45CDxuf3ebqsKiuQmzFhNWOriNvuJ-VkAtEJLHEzc/edit): native deck with all 46 slides and speaker notes.
- [Instructor guide](monday-2026-10-19/Monday_Instructor_Guide.html): five-minute preparation, pacing, answers, slide-by-slide teaching notes, and a shortened route.
- [Slides with speaker notes](monday-2026-10-19/UCB_MFE_Lesson_5_Python_Systems.pptx): 43 lesson slides plus 3 appendix/reference slides, exported from Google Slides after class.
- [Prepared notebook](monday-2026-10-19/Monday_Prepared_Notebook.ipynb): the 20 numbered examples plus 5 code cells added during class, with saved outputs and instructor answers.
- [Offline notebook reader](monday-2026-10-19/Monday_Notebook_Reader.html): the original 20 prepared examples and saved outputs. The notebook also includes additions made during class.

Keep these four files together so the guide's links work. Download the HTML files to view them in a browser. The notebook needs Python 3.12+ and NumPy; use the course environment. The numbered prepared examples include their own setup and imports. Classroom additions can depend on preceding cells; run the notebook from top to bottom. No API keys, external data, network calls, or GPU are required. All financial inputs are synthetic classroom examples. No homework deadline changes are introduced.

## January cohort source materials

- [Original January Lesson 5 deck shown during the October lessons](january-2026-reference/UCB_MFE_January_2026_Lesson_5.pptx): fresh October 22 export, preserving the original slides.
- [Original January Lesson 5 Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FHou4eBxzs5tR7WrhwNt9nwrgdjVmLQQ9CbrRGse8ZA/edit).
- **Slides**: `UCB_MFE_2026_Lesson_5_Updated.pptx`
- **Interactive Notebook**: `advanced_python_part1_interactive.ipynb`

The original Google deck and the existing updated PowerPoint are retained as distinct reference versions. Monday's October teaching package remains in `monday-2026-10-19`. See [Thursday's Lesson 6 materials](../Lecture%206/README.md) for the continuation and the prior-course concurrency/parallelism slides used in class.
