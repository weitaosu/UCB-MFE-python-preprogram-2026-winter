# October 29: Backtesting stock-selection models

Yang · 9am–noon Pacific · second Modeling session. Plan for **150 minutes including a ten-minute break**, leaving the remaining scheduled time for questions. [HW4](hw4.md) is due November 12, 2026.

Build a backtest that tracks cash and overlapping stock positions, then compare a model fitted once with one refitted quarterly. Both notebooks use the small class database, run independently, and end with exercises.

## Class schedule

| Time | Notebook | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| 9:00–10:20 | [1. Backtest a stock-selection strategy](1_backtesting.ipynb) | Entry and exit timing, lots, fees, daily marks, exposure limits, and NAV metrics |
| 10:20–10:30 | Break | Ten minutes |
| 10:30–11:20 | [2. Compare fixed and retrained models](2_research_workflow.ipynb) | Hyperparameter selection, quarterly fits, completed labels, portfolio comparisons, and saved results |
| 11:20–11:30 | HW4 questions | Strategy choices, results, and submission |

Exercises can be completed after class.

## Preparation

Use `uv sync --locked`, select `.venv`, and place `equities_class.duckdb` from bCourses at `Lectures/modeling/data/`. Read the [data guide](../modeling/README.md). The class database is under 5 MiB, with pre-2016 history; HW4 uses the full union of quarterly top-2,000 selections and the April 2016–September 2026 final period.

The research notebook saves its results under `Lectures/modeling/outputs/`, which is ignored by Git.

## Preparing for HW4

Choose your own features, model, and trading strategy. The [assignment](hw4.md) defines the common trading rules and deliverables; the lecture strategies are examples you can learn from and adapt.

| Task | Helpful examples |
|---|---|
| Engineer features | 7.2: trailing prices, financial statements, and sector comparisons |
| Train and validate a model | 7.1: sklearn interfaces and pipelines; 7.3: chronological validation and model comparison |
| Build a backtester | 8.1: purchases, overlapping lots, cash, fees, and daily NAV |
| Evaluate the strategy | 8.1: performance metrics; 8.2: benchmark comparisons and diagnostics |
| Explore retraining | 8.2: fixed and quarterly-refitted models; retraining is optional in HW4 |

Write your own backtester. You may reuse lecture loading and preprocessing code, and should cite anything you adapt.

## Discussion questions

- Does a $100,000 inclusive budget purchase $100,000 of exposure after fees?
- Can an April closing sale fund an order decided the previous night?
- Can three individually small purchases collectively breach a sector cap?
- What happens to two lots in the same ticker with different maturities?
- Why is a missing last row not evidence of a delisting?
- Why do terminal open positions affect NAV but not necessarily the predictive metric sample?
- What is frozen in a walk-forward experiment, and what is refitted?
- If a model improves rank IC but reduces portfolio returns, which tables would help explain the difference?
