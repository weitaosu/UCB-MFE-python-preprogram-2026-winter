HW 1 starter files and the submission folder layout are in [Homeworks/HW1](Homeworks/HW1/README.md).

## Goal
- Level up your coding skills
- Help you to succeed in an entry-level / internship position of data scientist / quant developer

## How to get the most of this course
- Attend live sessions and ask a lot of questions
- Review class materials and do homework right after the class, as learning curve is pretty steep.

## Operating System
- Most of the class materials are prepared with macOS 
- All class materials should work seamlessly with both Windows and Linux systems

## Extra Materials
- Relevant materials will be [linked](...) inline.
- It's highly recommended, but not a must to go over the linked materials. The course is self-contained.

## Grading
- Pass / No-Pass
- In order to pass, students needs to complete all homeworks on-time.
- Do your homework as soon as possible.

## Late Policy
- Each student will be given **three** free late days, with each late day being equivalent to 24 hours of lateness. 
- Assignments are considered either on time or late by whole days; for instance, an assignment is either on time, 1 day late, 2 days late, etc. 
- Due to the leniency of this policy, no extensions will be granted for assignments under any circumstances. 
- No assignment will be accepted if it is submitted more than 3 days after its due date.

## Communication
- Most of the communication and announcement will be sent via Slack.
- Most of the questions should be asked & answered in the group channel.
- Yang, Aneesh & GSIs will routinely check the channel to make sure all questions are answered.

## Running the notebooks

- From the project root, run `uv sync --locked` and select the project's `.venv` Python interpreter as your notebook kernel.
- Run each notebook with its lecture folder as the working directory. The reorganized data-analysis notebooks also support the repository root and their reference folders.
- Data analysis has two covered notebooks from October 8 (Lecture 2) and four on October 15 (Lecture 4). The deferred visualization/cleaning module opens Lecture 4, followed by SQL, a risk report, and automated reporting. Lecture 4's guide plans 150 minutes including a ten-minute break. Each notebook has a continuous lesson with visible worked examples and exercises at the end; Lecture 4 retains optional references.
- Lecture 4 generates seeded synthetic stock histories inside its opening cleaning notebook. Lecture 2's optional Jupyter tutorial includes a historical sample; default runs work without an API key.
- Worked examples use different inputs or questions from the final exercises. Exercise prompts, starter cells, and feedback stay together at the end; the lesson runs independently of student answers.
- Lecture 4's default report batch deliberately includes one invalid ticker: three reports succeed, one failure is recorded, and the comparison uses successful outputs only.
- Lecture 4 requires the bCourses database at `Lectures/Lecture 4/data/data.db`.
- Lecture 6's October 22 prepared notebook uses only the standard library, simulated I/O and no external services; its cell outputs are cleared for live teaching. The older reference notebook's HTTP examples require internet access, and its multiprocessing example uses the adjacent `lecture6_workers.py` module.
- Lectures 7 and 8 use real equity data from `Lectures/modeling/data/equities_class.duckdb` (30 selected stocks, under 5 MiB). HW4 uses `equities_top2000.duckdb` (3,849 stocks across quarterly top-2,000 lists, January 2000–September 2026, about 315 MiB). Download both from bCourses; see the [modeling data guide](Lectures/modeling/README.md). There is no synthetic fallback.
- Database files, local credentials, and generated reports are not tracked.
